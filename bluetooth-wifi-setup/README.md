## What It Does

This addon solves the problem of configuring WiFi on headless Home Assistant installations (no keyboard/monitor/mouse) by providing a Bluetooth interface for WiFi setup. Perfect for:

- Moving your HA device to a new location with different WiFi
- Recovery when the current WiFi network becomes unavailable
- Initial setup without ethernet access

Uses the BTBerryWifi mobile app (iOS/Android) to scan networks, enter credentials, and configure WiFi through Bluetooth Low Energy.
