class Wpa_Network:
    '''
    object describing the network in the wpa_supplicant_file - as it is saved on disk
    it should be managed to always represent what is saved on disk.
    Note: conflict is not saved on disk per se:
        it is a flag that indicates that the lock status what is saved on disk is different 
        than what is seen by the rpi scan 
            i.e.: ssid is locked on disk file but an ssid of the same name is braodcasting as open network.

    Conflicts:
    A conflict exists when a known network stored in the RPi has a given encryption status (ex: Locked/psk) 
        but the current scan shows a different encryption status (ex: open) 
        the ios app will received the scanned value (here open) - but the known network will attempt to connect 
        using the sotred information (in this case locked: psk - password).
    this basically means that the status of the network was changed on the router since the user last connected to it.
    Rather than try to manage all cases of conflicts - the code does simply this:
        - if a conflict between scann vs stored network is found 
            - the stored network is deleted
            - the network is added to the list of unknown networks for the user to reconnect, 
                at which point it will be shown a password box on the ios app, adn the user can enter the password
                (or if open, the connection will be establish by simply clicking on it.)
            - special case for hidden ssid:  hidden ssid once connected to are part of the known networks and can be scanned.
                If found to be in conflict - the known network is deleted from the RPi, 
                but it will continue to appear in thge unknown network list - since it was scanned,
                for as long as the app is connected by bluetooth to the RPi.
                If user exists app and restart - it will no longer be found and will have to be re-connected to by entering both ssid and password
                like any hidden ssid.

        The class WPAConf maintains a directory wpa_supplicants_ssid where:
            - for wpa_supplicant implementations:
                - the key is the ssid name (from the wpa_supplicant.conf file)
                - the value is this Wpa_Network object
            - for Network manager implementations:
                - the key is the network NAME given by Network Manager (which may be different from the ssid)
                - the value is this Wpa_Network object
        by storing the network name in the object, the object can be passed around and operations 
            that need the network name for network manager can be performed without having to seach for the ssid 
            in all the values of the directory to find the key (network name)
        Note: for wpa_supplicant implementations - store the ssid in the network name.
