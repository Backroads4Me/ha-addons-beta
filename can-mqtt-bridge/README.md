## What It Does

This addon initializes CAN interfaces on your Home Assistant system and bridges CAN bus traffic to MQTT topics, enabling:

- Monitor CAN bus traffic in real-time via MQTT
- Send CAN frames through MQTT publish
- Integrate CAN devices with Home Assistant automations
- Log and analyze CAN communications
- Support for standard and extended CAN frame formats

Uses Home Assistant's Mosquitto broker (or custom MQTT broker) for seamless integration.
