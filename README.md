# Backroads4Me Home Assistant Add-ons - BETA

⚠️ **BETA TESTING REPOSITORY** - This repository contains beta testing versions of Home Assistant add-ons. These are more stable than alpha releases but still pre-release versions that may contain bugs.

**Docker images use the `-beta` suffix** (e.g., `ghcr.io/backroads4me/amd64-bluetooth-wifi-setup-beta`)

For stable production versions, see the [main repository](https://github.com/Backroads4Me/ha-addons).

This repository contains a collection of my Home Assistant add-ons in beta testing.
